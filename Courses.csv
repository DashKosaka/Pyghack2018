"Humanities - Hist & Phil, and Cultural Studies - US Minority course.Topic: Caribbean Latino Migrations Description: From the aftermath of Hurricane Maria to the global hit-song ""Despacito"" andthose who star in baseball, the Caribbean Latino presence in U.S. society surrounds us. This course is geared toward developinga historical understanding about Caribbean Latinos in the United States. Through course materials, class discussions, and lectureswe explore the political and cultural relationships established between the U.S. and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, the processof community building for Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans in the U.S. as well as transnationally, and how CaribbeanLatinos reconcile their place in the United States with their historical pasts. Individual and group exercises along with writtenassignments will be used to accomplish the course's major aims: to further develop our ability to think critically, write analytically, andto understand U.S. Caribbean Latinos in a historically nuanced manner. Graded assignments will consist of response papers, a 5-7page critical essay, and exams.",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 2 hoursSouthern African Wildlife IMeets 27-Aug-18 - 19-Oct-18.Students will examine animal physiology, interpret behavior, and analyze the positive and negative human-wildlife interactions takingplace in Southern Africa, as well as the effects these interactions have on both humans and wild animals. Students will understandthe global influence on animal management and explore potential solutions to the social conflicts surrounding managementpractices. Through this review, students will be able to analyze the origins and nature of contemporary conservation, foodproduction, and overall human and animal wellbeing. No prerequisites. This will be an online course with lectures and assignmentspresented electronically. Lectures will include contributions by noted wildlife guide Andrew Schaefer. Not all in-class discussions willbe required. The instructor will announce more information before the first day of class. For students who wish to participate in theACES South Africa Wildlife Discovery program that takes place over the summer, this will make a great course to take before thetrip; however, all students are welcome to take the course.",,,,,,

Through this course, students will design and teach arts and public engagement projects in avariety of settings including community centers and schools. They will explore their identities as artists, educators, and citizens.Students will learn the basics of project and curriculum design, as well as teaching methods that are responsive to differentaudiences and settings. Students will learn how to assess impact of their projects and teaching. The course welcomes all students;no prior teaching or community-based education experience necessary. Non-art education majors should expect to spend 1 day /3 hours per week at a community site during the after-school hours (e.g. 2:00-5:00) during the second half of the semester.

"Credit Hours: 3 hoursBus as a Force in Am SocietyCamp Honors/Chanc Schol course.Others may enroll with the permission of the instructor and the Campus Honors Program provided there is space available beforeclasses begin. Business is comprised of companies, industries, and the privately owned commercial sector of the Americaneconomy. Business is a major institution and powerful force in American society. It accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy andis the source of employment, compensation and benefits, and meaningful work for tens of millions of employed citizens. Businessprovides the goods and services that underpin the American standard of living. With business's benefits come many consequences.The American form of capitalism is relatively hard-edged and offers exceptional personal opportunity for high achievement andwealth creation. It also entails job insecurity, income inequality, and environmental strain. Healthy pursuit of self-interest sometimesmorphs into greed, entitlement and corruption. Opinions run strong among Americans about business as an institution. Some loveit, others hate it and many are ambivalent. Opinions wax and wane depending on the times and recent events. The purpose of thiscourse is to challenge and enable students in CHP to think about business in a holistic and analytical way and to develop opinionsabout business issues in a thoughtful, fact-based manner. The course will also help inform students' thinking about career choice.These goals will be accomplished by looking at business through several lenses, including descriptive, critical and practical. Wewill also consider throughout the course the question, “What is a good company?” The first six weeks of the course are devotedto conceptual material, company case studies and short lectures. The remainder of the course is devoted to sessions created bystudents with guidance and feedback from Professor White. Students select a topic of interest, write a brief presentation prospectus,then develop and deliver a professional quality presentation.

"Credit Hours: 3 hoursPolymer RheologyRestricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.Polymer Rheology Course builds a molecular understanding of polymer characterization and properties and develops a link betweenthe physical chemistry of the microstructure and the macroscopic behaviors. The course begins with polymeric descriptions froma physical basis and continues with polymer solution thermodynamics in the context of Flory-Huggins theory. After fundamentals,the course considers polymer characterization from a rheological (flow and deformation) perspective with overage of dynamics,linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity, the rheology of dilute and networked polymer systems, and time-temperature superposition.The course concludes with models for dilute polymeric suspensions, unentangled polymer melts, entanglements, and the reptationmodel.

"North AfricaHumanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.Meets 22-Oct-18 - 12-Dec-18.Topic: 'North Africa from Prehistory to the Arab Spring'. This course explores the deep and recent past of North Africa. Some ofour first Homo sapiens ancestors called Morocco home. In an Iron Age royal purge, Princess Dido fled her Lebanese homeland tofound the city of Carthage (modern-day Tunis) and become its first queen. The Roman Republic fought three costly wars over a118-year period to conquer North Africa from Carthage, eventually burning the city to the ground. So fertile and full of resources,the region—today known as the Maghreb—later became the breadbasket and olive oil jar of the Roman Empire. In addition to theindigenous Amazigh people (a.k.a. Numidian or Berber), wave after wave of migrant populations and colonial powers have shapedthe region including Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, and Europeans. In modern times, the North African nation ofTunisia was the first country to revolt in the movement that has become known as the Arab Spring. We will study the archaeology,history, environment, and culture of North Africa within its geopolitical context as a crossroads of the Sahara, the Mediterranean, theNear East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Students are encouraged to bring their own interests (art, music, literature, technology) to theirexperience of the class. No prerequisites.",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 3 hoursCyber DystopiaSection Info: Analyzing the Adverse Impacts of Advances in Computer Technology. The information revolution is bringing changesthat are not always seen as positive to the people they affect. Nevertheless there is a strong feeling that the changes it bringsare inevitable and that our efforts should be devoted to advancing, enjoying, and profiting from cyber technologies rather thanrestraining them. But do our efforts in this direction risk the emergence of a cyber dystopia in which many, perhaps most, people aresignificantly harmed by technology advances? This course focuses on insights into the downsides of this technological progress.We will characterize key aspects of the problem, assess their severity, predict their future, speculate on how much of what we arefacing is inevitable, and think about what steps might avoid the most undesirable outcomes. This will be guided by reading and classdiscussion of recent works on the topic and a project. Learn more from the course web site https://tinyurl.com/cyberdystopia.",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 4 hoursAdversarial Machine LearningRestricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.Machine learning has seen a remarkable rate of adoption in recent years across a broad spectrum of industries and applications.Many applications of machine learning techniques are adversarial in nature, insofar as the goal is to understand adversarialstrategies and therefore detect or defend against attacks. Forensic analysis of malware, which incorporates clustering, anomalydetection, and even vision systems in autonomous vehicles, are all potentially subject to attack. In response to these concerns,there is an emerging literature on adversarial machine learning, which spans both the analysis of vulnerabilities in machine learningalgorithms and algorithmic techniques which yield more robust learning. In this class, we will survey an array of these issues andtechniques from both the cybersecurity and machine learning research areas. In particular, we consider the problems of adversarialevasion, where the attacker changes behavior to escape being detected, and poisoning, where training data itself is corrupted.We discuss both the evasion and poisoning attacks and the associated defensive techniques in deep neural networks and othermachine learning models. We also consider techniques and applications of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Prerequisites:This course is restricted to students with machine learning and deep learning background. The students should be comfortableimplementing and training standard deep neural networks in standard frameworks like pytorch or tensorflow.",,,,,,

"Social Spaces on the InternetRestricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.Topic: Social Spaces on the Internet Social Spaces on the Internet. The Internet is home to a panoply of varieties of humaninteraction. Social media, interactive games, telepresence, online environments, and simple text e-mails now mediate our normalexperiences of education, medicine, politics, business, sociality, collective action, and more. Unbeknownst to many users, thesesystems incorporate algorithmic interventions that alter prior expectations. As the Internet has become an infrastructure for social lifeand society itself, our ability to measure and represent that society is transforming. This class explores the presentation of self, thepresentation of collectives, the presentation of news, and social dynamics in these online spaces — and how algorithmic interventionshapes them from the perspective of social signalling theory. Topics covered include: resumes of the 22nd century, why peopleshare “fake” news, the mitigation of trolling, ethics, and bias in social media systems. Upon completion of this course, students willhave an up-to-date understanding of the design of social media interfaces with incentive structures from social signaling theory.",,,,,,

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Non-West course.This course will attempt to express the diversity of a continent through a reading of texts from Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe,Cameroon, South Africa, and Sudan. At the same time however, the course will also endeavor to highlight the connections andlinks between representative writings from different regions of the continent. In demonstrating that all the regions we somewhatloosely group together as ‘modern Africa’ are also congruous in so far as they were all irredeemably transformed by the experienceof colonialism, the course will show how the term modern calls for precisely such an inter-textual understanding. At the end of thiscourse however, students should not only be familiar with symptomatic texts of African literature, but also should be able to read,write, and, think about these texts in an insightful manner, concentrating on developing abilities such as close-reading, comparativeanalysis, and argumentative logic.",,,,,,

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.Join us for an exciting journey into the world of the Global Middle Ages! Knights in shining armor fighting monsters. Saintsperforming miracles. Kings (and queens!) leading armies into battle. Monks offering prayers through their daily offices. Peasantstilling the fields. These are some of the most popular and enduring images of the Middle Ages, and in this course we will explore theliterature, art, and history that gave rise to our ideas of the romance and chivalry of the medieval period. Our goal will be to read abroad range of medieval literature (all in modern English translation) from around the world: England, the Continent, the Arab world,and Asia. We will explore a variety of genres, including epics, sagas, romances, fabliaux, riddles, drama, lyrics, and saints’ lives,and we will work to situate each work in its social and historical contexts with visits to the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, theSpurlock Museum, and the Krannert Art Museum.",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 3 hoursCultural Studies - US Minority course.Broadly speaking, this course will introduce you to the study of African American Literature. Our goal over the semester will be todraw a provisional map of African American literary production from the end of the eighteenth century to the dawn of the twentieth,from the Age of Revolutions to the World War I. Our storytelling will be guided by four principle frameworks: literary form andgenre, intellectual and political history, community formation, and the relation between African American and other literary culturesand traditions. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, novels, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Throughoutour discussions we will think about what’s “African American” about African American literature. Is it a set of political and socialcircumstances, the writer’s racial identity (self-identified or otherwise), a set of tropes or a style, an attitude and critical orientation,none of the above, all of the above? We’ll also think about this archive as doing a particular kind of work in the world that continuesand resonates to this day. Writers for consideration include: Phillis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, Frances E.W. Harper, and W.E.B.Du Bois.",,,,,,

"This course will offer you an introduction to the major ideas, problems, and critical trends that have shaped the study of literatureand culture over the past several decades. By the end of the semester, you will be familiar with the evolution of and interrelationsbetween a number of theoretical fields, including structuralism, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, postcolonial theory, indigenousstudies, critical race theory, digital humanities, visual studies, and feminist and queer theory. Some of the texts on the syllabus mightalready be familiar, but many certainly will not. In any case, the goal of the course will be to have you see familiar problems in a newlight and to develop new skills to think about the relationship between literature, culture, politics, and scholarship.

"Tai ChiRestricted to Dance or Dance major(s).Tai Chi exemplifies the subtlest principle of Taoism, known as wu-wei. This is often translated as “not doing” but its proper meaningis to act without forcing—to move in accordance with the flow of nature’s course that is signified by the word Tao. The spirit of wuwei is to make curves in the way wind and water move. T’ai Chi is one of the many ways to help discipline the body and find a wayto release tension. T’ai Chi can be a way of letting the body really teach you, be with you and help you to get through the conflictsyou encounter every day.",,,,,,

"Humanities - Hist & Phil, and Cultural Studies - Non-West course.Meets 22-Oct-18 - 12-Dec-18.Topic: China enjoys long and rich traditions. History of China can be traced back to the second millennium BC. China has been,more than once, one of the most powerful empires in world histories. Despite the fall of the last imperial dynasty over a centuryago and the rapid modernization in the last three decades, traditions are still in many ways central to Chinese people's identitiesespecially how Chinese view themselves in this ever-globalizing world. This course introduces a number of key aspects of traditionalChina from the Shang (c.1600-1046 BCE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), ranging from political thinking, rituals, law, the examsystem, religion, art and so forth. We will explore not only what these traditions were but also how they were contested, debated,and reconstructed by modern Chinese intellectuals and statesmen. This course combines both lectures and class discussions.",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 4 hoursApplied CryptographyRestricted to students with Senior or Graduate class standing.Prerequisites: ECE 422 / CS 461 or equivalent, or ECE 428 / CS 425 or equivalent. Cryptography is a powerful toolbox forbuilding secure systems - not just for private communication, but also for building fault tolerant protocols, for securely outsourcingcomputation to untrusted services, and more. The goal of this course is to introduce the concepts of modern cryptography, includinga combination of theoretical foundations (how do we precisely state security guarantees and assumptions, and prove that a protocolis designed correctly?) and practical techniques (how do we combine secure primitives to make effective systems?). This course isintended for senior undergraduate students with an interest in applying cryptographic techniques to building secure systems, and forgraduate students with an interest in cryptography or systems security.",,,,,,

We will start with an overviewof Brazilian economic and political history from the 1994 inflation stabilization up to now. In the remaining part we get into moredetails in the analysis of current important issues for the Brazilian economy. The first set of issues is related to macroeconomicstability, enclosing monetary and fiscal aspects. Then, we will tackle subjects related to social fairness: the social rights created bythe Brazilian Constitution, the educational system and policies, and the social programs created in Cardoso and Lula governments.Finally, we will discuss possible causes of the current fiscal crisis and economic stagnation, and proposed reforms. Required: ECON202 (Econ Statistics I); ECON 302 (Inter Micro Theory) or ECON 303 (Inter Macro Theory); MATH 220/221 (Calculus I) or otherCalculus course; Highly Recommended: ECON 203 (Econ Statistics II)- empirical and use regression analysis necessary for papers",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 3 hoursPolitical EconomyRestricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.Political Economy studies how self-interested, rational policy-makers make choices in an institutionalized environment. In thiscourse, students will utilize utility-maximization theories and tools of microeconomics to understand behavior of rational and goaldriven political actors. Students will study political outcomes and the interaction between the actors within the institutional constraintsof their environment. We will attempt to explain why the government behaves as it does and how its behavior influences and isin turn influenced by the behavior of private citizens. We will also investigate the effects of political institutions on political andeconomic outcomes and assess the relative performance of different political systems. **** Find Information about restrictions andoverrides: http://go.economics.illinois.edu/CoursesUndergrad ****",,,,,,

"Credit Hours: 4 hoursFirm DynamicsRestricted to students in the Economics department.Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.This is a graduate level course on the dynamic behavior of firms which includes their entry and exit decisions, and their growth andcontraction patterns. The goal of this course is to bring students to the frontier of firm dynamics which lies at the intersection ofmacroeconomics and industrial organization. In particular, we will analyze how heterogeneity in microeconomic forces at the firmlevel shape aggregate outcomes. This course consists of three sections. The first part focuses on available firm-level data, theirempirical patterns, and how to measure and estimate firm-level outcomes (e.g., volatility and markups). In the second part, we willcover the canonical models of firm dynamics and discuss extensions featured at the research frontier. In the third and last part, wewill analyze a variety of applications (time permitting), including: misallocation of resources, micro-origins of the business cycle,productivity growth, secular trends in business dynamism and profitability, innovation and pricing dynamics.",,,,,,

This course willserve as an introduction to the genre of fiction and it will help you develop the skills you need to close read and analyze fiction, aswell as to write about fiction argumentatively and persuasively. We will work on becoming familiar with different elements and termsused to analyze fiction, such as point of view, frame, focalization, character, narrative voice, plot, story, tone, setting, symbolism,intertextuality, and theme, to name a few. We will also practice the skill of close textual reading and learn strategies for effectiveargumentative writing. These critical literary skills of close reading and argumentative writing are important for this class and willstand you in good stead in other courses where you must communicate clearly and persuasively. Primary texts will be novels andshort stories. They may include: Anton Chekov’s “Misery,” Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw, Kate Chopin’s The Awakening,Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Ernest Hemingway’s In Our Time, Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Arundhati Roy’s The Godof Small Things, Karen Tei Yamashita’s The Tropic of Orange, Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners, Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’sChildren, and JM Coetzee’s Elizabeth Costello.",,,,,,

"Democracy in Hamilton’sCamp Honors/Chanc Schol, Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.Democracy in Hamilton’s America The award-winning Broadway musical, Hamilton, participates in a long tradition of defining theplace that we now know as the United States through its past. These fictional renderings are often not about getting the history“right” as msuch as they are about meeting the needs of what Frederick Douglass described as the “ever-living now.” We tell storiesabout the past to help us understand our present and chart paths to the future. Despite its diverse casting and championing ofdemocratic ideals, however, Hamilton’s narrative is pretty standard fare: a collection of ambitious white men defies the odds to“found” a new nation. What are the implications, then, of retelling this oft-repeated story with Miranda’s emphasis on Hamilton asan immigrant narrative in the twenty-first century? How have narratives about the American Revolution functioned over time, andhow have they shaped our understandings of democracy in America? To answer these questions, we’ll examine American literaryhistory and culture to think about the stories and people Hamilton draws on and leaves out. We’ll take a look at the documentsinforming Miranda’s lyrics, including the Federalist Papers and debates around the Declaration of Independence, women’s rights,and emancipation. We’ll read narratives from former slaves, radical women, abolitionists, American Indians, and white frontiersmen,and we’ll trace some of the musical’s key figures through visual culture and monuments. While most of our readings will come fromthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we’ll also survey Hamilton’s contemporary influences (modern Hip Hop and show tunes)alongside crossover segments on contemporary media (Black-ish and the Hamilton Mixtape) and democratic theory. Above all, we’llask ourselves, what is the meaning of “democracy” in Alexander Hamilton’s and Hamilton’s America?

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.This course covers British literature from 0 to 1800. Rather than aiming for coverage, we will read closely a limited set ofrepresentative works from different genres from the eighth to the late eighteenth century, including lyric poetry, drama, satire,polemical prose, and amatory fiction. In so doing, we’ll consider how politics, religion, and landscape shaped Britain’s nationalliterature. We’ll attend to the evolution of the English language. We’ll note how scholars use certain historical turning points to justifysuch boundaries as ‘medieval,’ ‘early modern,’ and ‘restoration.’ We’ll weigh the usefulness of this periodization, as well as thepotential problems with it. We will furthermore analyze our emotional engagement with the works we read. What formal qualities,themes, and conventions draw us in—or indeed, estrange us? What’s familiar about the distant past, and what’s alien, unexpected,and surprising? Expect to encounter such writers as Unknown, Marie de France, and Geoffrey Chaucer; William Shakespeare, JohnDonne, and Andrew Marvell; and William Wycherley, Jonathan Swift, and Eliza Haywood. Expect to visit, so to speak, the preachingcross near Solway firth, in what once was Northumbria; the city of York on the feast of Corpus Christi; the perilous court of KingHenry VIII; the Globe theater of Shakespeare and his Chamberlain’s Men; and the dressing room of an eighteenth-century lady. Weopen with one of the earliest poems in the Old English corpus, the Dream of the Rood. And finally, since according to Coleridge’sown notes the poem came to him in a dream-vision in 1797, we close with Kubla Khan.",,,,,,

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Non-West course.Modern African literature is the literature of a continent that includes many nation-states, languages, and ethnicities. It is therefore byno means a homogenous entity, and in many ways our course attempts to express this very diversity through a reading of texts fromNigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda, South Africa, and Sudan. At the same time however, “Introduction to Modern African Literature”also endeavors to highlight the connections and links between representative writings from different regions of the continent. Indeed,the term modern calls for precisely such an inter-connected understanding. After all the regions we somewhat loosely group togetheras ‘modern Africa’ are also congruous in so far as they were almost all irredeemably transformed by the experience of colonialism.The term ‘modern’ has in fact since then come to be inextricably tied to the distinct twists and turns of the colonial encounter. Tofollow these twists and turns, we will read through a wide array of literary material ranging from novels and plays to short stories,poems, and critical essays. You will notice right away that we are not following a necessarily chronological approach in our readingof this literature, but rather one that allows us to foreground the above thematic connections. That is, summarizing the plot ofthe texts will not be the work of this class. Our texts will resist this kind of reading in favor of an investigation that asks how themechanics and structures of language weave an intricate tapestry in which texts refer to each other, dialogue with each other andspeak back to each other. At the end of this course, students should not only be familiar with symptomatic texts of African literature,but also should be able to read, write, and, think about these texts in an insightful manner, concentrating on developing abilitiessuch as close-reading, comparative analysis, and argumentative logic. Finally, students should also be able to move outwards andto broaden the horizons of interpretation by allowing the close reading of an individual text to be informed by readings of socialstructures and political-cultural events.",,,,,,

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.From the daring exploits of the knights of the Round Table to the passionate love of Lancelot and Guinevere, few things encompassthe magic and adventure of the Middle Ages like the tales of King Arthur. Wielding the power of his sword Excalibur and the wisdomof his advisor Merlin, Arthur presides over a narrative kingdom of knights, quests, dragons, tournaments, maidens, wizards, castles,and fairies, whose interweaving stories make up one of the most capacious bodies of literature in world history. But Arthur is alsoa messianic figure, appearing in chronicles and histories, leading the people of Britain to freedom from tyranny, and promising toreturn when his country needs him the most. Arthurian myth and legend is one of the most enduring literary traditions of WesternEurope, and its characters and stories were as popular in the Middle Ages as they are today. Originating in early medieval Wales,the legends traveled through England to France and Germany and throughout the modern world. We will study the developmentof the Arthurian tradition in chronicles, poetry, romances, lais, and fabliaux, comparing variations across cultural and historicalboundaries. Our materials will range from the earliest sightings of Arthur in medieval histories through the defining stories ofChrétien, Gottfried, and Malory to modern adaptations of the legend on stage and screen.",,,,,,

We will read thesenovels with attention to both the formal experiments of their authors and the social and political issues they explicitly engaged.In doing so, we will develop a keener understanding of the history of the novel in the United States and appreciate the profoundimpact these writers had on American culture and readers, both then and now.

"Humanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - Western course.Early American Literature and Culture The title of this course is enticingly misleading. While we can look back on the history of thegeographic expanse we now denominate the United States and create a literary narrative, this narrative begins with an assumptionthat to be on the continent and write makes one an “American writer” and that what these writers produced we would call “literature.”European colonists, however, did not begin to call themselves “Americans” until the late eighteenth century, and a category of“American literature” turns out to be more of a cultural aspiration than a complete achievement by the mid-nineteenth century. Andjust as the geography of the continental United States began to reflect what we recognize it to be today, the country broke out intothe Civil War. These paradoxes and others endemic to American culture will guide our discussions, which will focus on how writersstruggled with the paradoxical issues that defined early America: freedom and slavery; individualism and federation; comity andconflict; region and nation; wilderness and settlement. To do so, we will canvass a variety of genres and forms, including poetry,sermons, travel narratives, fiction, and speeches, and we will explore the persistence of prominent tropes, forms, and ideas—and,as crucially, the decline and disappearance of others—between different eras and regions in light of this literary archive. Manyof the authors on the syllabus will be easily recognizable (such as Benjamin Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Herman Melville, andEmily Dickinson) and others may prove less familiar. In both cases, our goal will be to bring the literary past to life, and see howthese authors’ works and concerns still resonate in our current moment. The course requirements will be a mixture of short writingassignments and exams.",,,,,,

Taking seriously the theoretical and critical implications of thepopular hashtag “#blackgirlmagic,” we will consider how contemporary black women’s artistry speaks to the unique experiencesof African American women as well as to broader questions of identity, various forms of inequality, and social justice. We will askwhether there are particular artistic practices, political standpoints, or linguistic effects that mark certain visual and literary textsas “black women’s” texts, particularly now—and if so, what these are and how (and by whom) they are determined. We will alsoquestion how the black women artists we study address matters of race and nation, as well as atters of gender, sexuality, and class.In the process, we will consider how contemporary black women's cultural production both builds upon and moves beyond a longhistorical tradition of black women’s expression.

"Minority ImagesHumanities - Lit & Arts, and Cultural Studies - US Minority course.This course explores how movies made in the U.S. across the 20th century and into the 21st have represented diverse ethnic/racial (e.g., African American, Asian American, Latino/a, Native American) populations and cultures. The course also attendsclosely to how “racialized” images embed representations of gender and class. We will approach those issues through case studies(one feature film per week), both Hollywood movies and independently-produced works. We’ll study those productions within thecontexts of American media conventions and historically ingrained social attitudes and practices, and, as relevant, as alternatives orchallenges to dominant American racial ideologies. Case study films assigned to all for extended discussion in class might include,e.g., Birth of a Nation (1915); Salt of the Earth (1953); Zoot Suit (1981); Chan Is Missing (1982), Do the Right Thing (1989); andSmoke Signals (1998). The primary course text is Benshoff’s and Griffith’s America on Film: Representing Race, Class, Gender,and Sexuality at the Movies (2nd ed., 2009), supplemented by some essays which directly address the assigned films. Althoughthe sequence of films we’ll watch together as a class will enable an understanding of American cinema’s historical (but persistent)representations of “minorities,” students are encouraged to do research for writing assignments about contemporary media, whetherrecent feature films made for “the big screen” or productions for broadcast or cable television or through streaming services. Courserequirements include active participation in class discussion of readings and films, several short reports, a research essay, and afinal exam. The course meets General Education requirements for both Humanities and the Arts and U.S. Minority Cultures andfulfills a distribution requirement for English and MACS majors and minors.",,,,,,

"Love and SoundAdvanced Composition course.Writing about Literature: Love and Sound in the Age of Consumption The class will explore the limits of love and literary soundin post-1945 American literature. While you practice close reading as closely listening to the sounds of rhetorical play, you willprobe depictions of various kinds of love in works by William Faulkner, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Cynthia Ozick, DavidFoster Wallace, Thomas Pynchon, Leo Bersani, Elton Glaser, Audre Lorde, Claudia Rankine, and others. These works will notonly model the rhetorical strategies you will use for your own writing, from anadiplosis to anaphora, but they will also help youanswer the following questions about the interface between love and politics in a consumerist era. How has the economic shiftfrom a producer to a consumer society over the course of the twentieth century shaped popular definitions of romantic love? Isromantic love necessarily a love between subjects or can it flow from objects as well? Is there an object love? How have love andterror been combined in acts of racial, gender, and economic violence, from cultural theft to mass imprisonment? How, ironically,has love engendered violence? How have civil laws shaped and undermined expressions of love among lovers, relatives, andrelative strangers? What, finally, is the relationship between love and mourning, love and death, when images of the dead aremass-produced? You will explore one or all of these questions (the choice will be yours) as you practice writing about literatureacross a range of genres: the narrative essay, the long and short-form review for a lay public, the personal essay, and the formalscholarly study. You will come to see that the sound of your words, sentences, paragraphs—sounds you will be able to namewith seismographic precision—are not accessories to your essays, not flourishes and flights, once you clarify your argumentsand pronounce their stakes. The sounds, rather, will lead you to what your arguments are and what makes them, well, sound. Bylearning the techniques of literary sound—antimeria, antithesis, prolepsis, hyperbole, catachresis, pleonasm, pleonasm! and somuch more—you will come to know and practice what you’ve loved all along. Writing about literature will fundamentally becomewriting about love.",,,,,,

"Screen Adaptations:Advanced Composition course.Screen Adaptations:Transforming the Written Word into Film This topic under the English 300 rubric focuses on strategies thatwriters and filmmakers have used to adapt fiction, plays and “real life stories” to the screen. We will focus primarily on films originallymade in the U.S. and Britian for “the big (silver) screen”—(however later distributed!), that is, mostly feature length narrative filmsreleased to cinemas. But we will also consider the “made for TV” movie, which often mines newspaper headlines and celebritystories as its core material and also a few international films (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Italian), translating tales and styles acrosslanguages and cultural forms. The course will begin by exploring key issues in word-to-screen transformations, with students readingsections of “how to adapt” screenwriting texts. Successive units will focus on source-specific popular cinematic adaptations fromtheater, including Shakespeare plays; on “heritage style” films based on 18th- 20th century British and American novels (e.g., JaneAusten, F. Scott Fitzgerald); and on docudramas (films “based on a true story”) and “biopics” (fictionalized biographies of famousor infamous people). Throughout the course we will also consider issues of screen-to-screen remakes and occasionally screen-to-word reworkings, e.g., novelizations. Writing assignments will encourage students to develop their skills in researching and writingabout theories and practices of screen adaptations critically, comparatively, and creatively (one assignment will ask students todraft a mini-screenplay adapting source material). Course reading will include one book on adaptation as a particular practice ofscreenwriting, possibly a second text, and in any case a printed packet of relevant and engaging critical articles. [The professorwill email students enrolled as of August 10 to announce the specific assigned book title(s); information will not be available beforethen).] Besides offering opportunities (and the required credit!) for advanced composition, the course aims to help students developtheir understanding of the production and critical reception of adaptations, cultural forms which are often recast trans-nationally andhistorically (and sometimes across genres) to very diverse effects from the so-called “original.” Alongside considering adaptationsacross media forms, the course will address issues of gender, race/ethnicity, and class, all in relation to both the “adapting” mediainstitutions and to the representations that emerge. We will thus address the question of whose literary works or biographiesget adapted, by whom, in what ways, and for which anticipated audiences. Please note: although we will watch a number of filmexcerpts in class, students will need to watch in full several assigned films outside class time (available as DVDs on reserve in theundergraduate library media center or likely available through streaming services, according to student preference.)",,,,,,

"How to Interpret Literature:“How to Interpret Literature: An Introduction to Contemporary Critical Theory.” This course is required for English literature majorsand is best not delayed for long. Seniors usually regret not taking it sooner. Literature students write, think, and speak literarycriticism, and this course sets out to make that process more interesting and—eventually—more fun. In the last half century,critics have repeatedly reinvented literary and cultural criticism in ways that can deeply influence how we interpret what we readand how we understand our daily lives. We will study such critical movements as new criticism, structuralism and narratology,deconstruction and poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, feminism, queer studies, Marxism, new historicism, cultural studies, racestudies, postcolonial studies, disability studies, and ecocriticism. Expect some difficult reading, but we will work through it together.This course prepares students for future literature classes, and more to the point, it helps us understand and question the worldaround us and the entire project of critical thinking and reading. Attendance will be crucial, for we learn these concepts both byreading and by working with the concepts together. If you like to stay silent in class, or if you do not attend class regularly, then donot take this section. Class time will focus on discussion, not on lecture, so you need to be there in the room and in the discussion.",,,,,,

"This course will introduce students to the various issues and debates central to contemporary literary studies. If you have everwondered why people interpret certain texts, and even certain events and actions, as they do, then this is the course for you.The class will begin by exploring the ways in which three profoundly different thinkers, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, introduced apeculiarly suspicious form of reading, a way of interrogating texts and the world that looks beneath the surface and doubts that whatyou see is what you get. We will go on to explore how literary critics in the 20th century worked to map this Modern “hermeneuticof suspicion” onto political, psychological, and philosophical issues that still have an effect on us today. Finally, the course willengage with literature’s relationship to questions of sexual and racial difference, of power, and of technology. Requirements willinclude active class-participation, weekly journal entries, two short papers, and two exams. Texts will include Freud’s Interpretationof Dreams, Marx’s The Communist Manifesto, Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals and a Course Packet with essays by critics inthe Gender, psychoanalytic, Marxist, and Post-Structuralist traditions. It is strongly recommended that all English and Teaching ofEnglish majors take ENGL 300 and ENGL 301 BEFORE taking any other 300- or 400-level courses.",,,,,,

Along the way, we will ponder literary responses to changinggender and race relations, World War I, the roaring twenties, and the Great Depression. We will also consider the growth ofModernism and its revolutions in literary form as well as the relation between experiments in literary form and the era’s socialand political conservatisms and radicalisms. We will read fiction by some of the most celebrated writers in American literature—Ernest Hemingway (short stories), F. Scott Fitzgerald (short stories), William Faulkner (The Sound and the Fury)—as well asequally amazing novels and stories by less canonized or more recently canonized writers, including Nella Larsen’s Passing, DorothyParker’s short stories, Anita Loos’s Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, short fiction by Bruce Nugent, Dashiell Hammett’s The MalteseFalcon, and Carson McCullers’ The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. We will also read a greatest hits selection of a wide variety of poemsby H.D., William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Wallace Stevens, and others.

"Modern African fiction is the fiction of a continent that includes many nation-states, languages, and ethnicities. It is therefore by nomeans a homogenous entity, and in many ways our course attempts to express this very diversity through a reading of texts fromNigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Egypt, South Africa, and Sudan. At the same time however, “Modern African Fiction” also endeavorsto highlight the connections and links between representative writings from different regions of the continent. Indeed, the termmodern calls for precisely such an inter-connected understanding. After all the regions we somewhat loosely group together as‘modern Africa’ are also congruous in so far as they were almost all irredeemably transformed by the experience of colonialism.The term ‘modern’ has in fact since then come to be inextricably tied to the distinct twists and turns of the colonial encounter. Tofollow these twists and turns, we will not only read through a wide array of fictional material, but also through a range of criticalessays that demonstrate how questions of colonialism, modernity, feminism, nationalism, and literature/culture converge upon oneanother. You will notice right away that we are not following a necessarily chronological approach in our reading of this literature,but rather one that allows us to foreground the above thematic connections. That is, summarizing the plot of the texts will not be thework of this class. Our texts will resist this kind of reading in favor of an investigation that asks how the mechanics and structuresof language weave an intricate tapestry in which texts refer to each other, dialogue with each other and speak back to each other.At the end of this course, students should not only be familiar with symptomatic texts of African literature, but also should be ableto read, write, and, think about these texts in an insightful manner, concentrating on developing abilities such as close-reading,comparative analysis, and argumentative logic. Finally, students should also be able to move outwards and to broaden the horizonsof interpretation by allowing the close reading of an individual text to be informed by readings of social structures and political-cultural events.",,,,,,

"French Lit meets Queer TheoryFrench Literature Meets Queer Theory: The founding texts of American queer theory have a marked affinity with French literatureand the nineteenth century. Michel Foucault famously claimed in The History of Sexuality that “the homosexual” became a speciesaround 1870; Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick likewise based her Epistemology of the Closet on nineteenth- and turn-of-the-century texts,including the work of Marcel Proust. This seminar will confront French nineteenth- and twentieth-century novels that arguablyconstitute a queer French canon (Balzac, Gautier, Proust, Colette, Genet, Leduc) with classic essays in queer theory by Frenchand American critics (Foucault, Barthes, Wittig, Sedgwick, Butler and others). We will investigate queer theory’s roots in classicFrench literature and ask how that corpus can still fruitfully dialogue with more recent trends in queer and critical theory. Lectures inFrench; seminar discussions in French and English. Graduate students from programs other than French Studies may opt to submitall written work in English.",,,,,,

Specifically, we will emphasize issues for adults with disabilitieswithin American society. Beginning with the institutionalization of individuals with significant disabilities in the 1900s, to the rush toprovide services to returning WW II injured veterans, to the passage of laws guaranteeing access to education and employmentin the 1970s, to the current models of providing access to housing, employment and leisure through self-advocacy and personalempowerment, students will learn about the evolution of education, housing, employment and recreation for adults with disabilities.We will include adults with all disabilities, including intellectual, physical, and mental health. The course will utilize pertinent readings,media, and guest speakers. An important component of the class will be the community-based experience. Students will have theopportunity to interview and interact with adults with disabilities in the local community.",,,,,,

"CyberGISCyberGIS - This course will offer a comprehensive introduction to CyberGIS: the synthesis of Cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and SpatialAnalysis. Designed from a research-driven perspective, GEOG 479 will leverage CyberGIS architecture to facilitate spatial thinkingand knowledge discovery from geospatial Big Data. The specific topics included in this course are tailored to cover geospatial BigData processing, analysis, and visualizations. In particular, students will have chances to play with geospatial Big Data in variousforms (e.g., geo-located Twitter data, Taxi trajectory data and national DEM, etc.); and learn to solve geospatial problems with high-performance computing environments (e.g., Apache Hadoop and Spark) and data visual-analytic toolkits (parallel MapAlgebra,Python, D3.js, etc.) This course also provides carefully crafted materials for hands-on training by accessing the computingenvironment setup in the world's first GIS supercomputer, ROGER (Resourcing Open Geo-spatial Education and Research) namedafter Roger Tomlinson (Father of GIS).",,,,,,

"Women/Pop Cult Mid-East/NAfricRestricted to Global Studies major(s).Meets 22-Oct-18 - 12-Dec-18.In this course we focus on representations of women created by women within popular culture, primarily in the MENA region andalso other predominantly Muslim societies and diaspora communities. Academic and journalistic texts, images, videos, socialmedia profiles and music will be critiqued for how they present the complexity of women’s roles and identities. Through readings,discussions, and a final project, students will seek to answer: What does it mean to be a woman in the modern Middle East orto be a Muslim woman in the world today? How are women’s various social, religious, and civic identities negotiated on a dailybasis? How are women’s representations in popular culture and self-representations being read and received by local and globalaudiences?",,,,,,

"Global HomelessnessMeets 27-Aug-18 - 19-Oct-18.This course investigates the problem of global homelessness. Based on the concept of “surplus people,” the seminar investigatesthe contemporary production of people without adequate housing. Among the questions we will address are these: What is theprocess by which housing is constructed in a given place, and what social, political, and economic relationships does that create,change, or shape? What is the relationship between political and economic globalization and homelessness? What factors canameliorate the problem of homelessness?",,,,,,

A theme throughout this course will be the ideological constructionof a European other (an imaged “not-Europe”) and internal and external othering processes. Special emphasis will be given tostudying nationalist populism in Europe (in comparison to the United States) and its relation to neoliberal capitalism, religion,nativism, immigration, and globalization.",,,,,,

"Armed Non-State ActorsMeets 27-Aug-18 - 19-Oct-18.This introductory-level course provides a survey of the actors that pose the greatest challenge to the modern state-system, andwho therefore account for a majority of contemporary armed conflicts. The course takes as its starting point Max Weber’s definitionof a state as an organized political entity that has a monopoly on the use of force within a given territory, and imbeds it within inthe context of the modern state system established with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. It then juxtaposes relevant armed non-state actors (ANSAs) against this standard and context. While the most common of these actors are rebel groups and terroristorganizations, the course also examines the existence of drug cartels, organized crime groups, bandits, and pirates, as well as thoseactors that align themselves with state governments, such as paramilitaries, private security companies/mercenaries, militias, andvigilante groups. Students will not only learn about these actors, but the interplay between them and states, between each other,and the challenges and threats they pose to domestic, regional, and international security. Upon completion of the course, studentswill have gained a more comprehensive understanding of world politics and the complex, interdependent forces at play in a variety ofoutcomes.",,,,,,

"Prison, Race, and TerrorTopic:""Prison, Race, and Terror."" Meets with AAS 390, Sec. NP (CRN 51335) & LLS 396, Sec. NP (CRN 64012). The United Stateshas the highest rate of incarceration in the world. In addition to the 2.5 million people imprisoned under the criminal justice system,the U.S. government captures even more people into carceral spaces within and beyond its borders. This course examines the U.S.prison regime—manifested not only in the prison as a physical place or institution, but also enacted in active practices that seek toshore up state authority by exercising extraordinary power over inmates.Reading scholarship in critical ethnic studies, particularlyregarding U.S. prisons, immigration, and warfare, we will examine three areas of U.S. imprisonment—criminal justice, immigrantdetention, and martial imprisonment. We will focus on narratives told from the perspectives of prisoners—in autobiographies,documentary films, and testimonies.",,,,,,
